                <p>I've been playing a lot of video games in my free time.</p>

                <p>Here are some games I've clocked a bunch of hours in no particular order:</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Apex Legends</li>
                    <li>Slay the Spire</li>
                    <li>Cyberpunk 2077</li>
                    <li>Stolen Realm</li>
                    <li>Omega Strikers</li>

                    <p>Apex Legends is a free First Person Shooter battle royale, where you or a squad of your friends join together to become the last squad standing.</p>
                    <p>With its varied character and weapon selection and regularly changing map pool, I find myself regularly coming back to this game with a group of my friends.</p>

                    <p>Slay the Spire is one of the best deck building games I've ever played. Climb the Spire by defeating enemies or make deck altering choices through events. The catch is, if your character dies, you have to start from square one. </p>

                    <p>The varied enemy pool, pickable cards, and random relics makes every run varied and unique. The slow methodical nature of the game makes it a unique experience that is hard to replicate.</p>

                    <p>After Cyberpunk's disastrous release, CD Projekt Red regular and continual updates to the game has brought back Cyberpunk 2077 into a playable state.The fantastic worldbuilding and art direction really sucks you into Night City. The characters are varied and interesting.</p>

                    <p> It does suffer from some game bloat, making many encounters feel samey and uninteresting. Some bugs also pull through even after all the patches and updates, creating some immersion breaking moments, but overall, still a fun and relaxing time. </p>

                    <p>Stolen Realm is a turn based RPG that takes some inspiration from its predacessors. It has a similar mapping system as Slay the Spire while borrowing many gameplay aspects from Divinity Original Sin.</p>
                    <p>Although not a wholly unique experience, it draws some of the good points of both games. A touch of randomness through the encounters and a touch of control of what kind of character you want to play through it skill trees. It suffers some balance issues, but is still overall quite an enjoyable experience.</p>

                    <p>Oh boy. Omega Strikers. I didn't expect having a blast playing this game. I never really played sports games, but throw in some super powers? That's a fun time.
                    </p>

                    <p>I played Omega Strikers for a while for its air hockey/soccer/ MOBA experience. The high skill cap and a unique, blood pumping gameplay loop made me enjoy a game genre I never expected to. As all games that aspire to have a competitive scene, it has its flaws but I thoroughly enjoyed the many times it's been fun.
